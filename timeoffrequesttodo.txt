Update the HR system allow employees to request time off. 
This request should include start/end date, employee, supervisor, status.

TODO:
Start date must be in the future and end date must be after that.
- test that a date is after another date
- confirm the employee does not already have time off for those days
-- check date overlaps with other dates
- confirm the employee has enough time off available
-- count the days off and make sure it isn't greater than another number

Employee and supervisor cannot be the same.
